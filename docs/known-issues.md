# Known Issues

## None! 🎉

All planned features are fully implemented:
- ✅ All 20 problem × algorithm combinations working
- ✅ Side-by-side comparison mode functional
- ✅ Problem switching fully integrated
- ✅ All controls wired to experiments

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

These are NOT issues, just ideas for future expansion:
- Animation playback of experiment trajectories
- Experiment result recording and replay
- Custom experiment creation UI
- Experiment sharing via URL parameters
- Additional problem types (Himmelblau, Beale, etc.)
