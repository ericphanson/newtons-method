# Known Issues

## Experiment System

- [ ] Compare experiments not fully implemented (need side-by-side view)
- [ ] Problem switching doesn't actually change objective function yet
- [ ] Custom dataset loading needs full integration

## Future Work

- Implement actual problem switching in algorithm logic
- Add side-by-side comparison mode
- Wire problem domain to visualization bounds
