  "keyInsight": "The two-loop recursion in Algorithm 7.4 avoids the O(d²) cost of explicitly forming and multiplying with the Hessian approximation. Instead, it computes the product H_k * ∇f_k using O(md) operations by performing two passes through the m stored vector pairs.",
  "quotedText": "Without considering the multiplication H_k^0 q, the two-loop recursion scheme requires 4mn multiplications; if H_k^0 is diagonal, then n additional multiplications are needed.",
