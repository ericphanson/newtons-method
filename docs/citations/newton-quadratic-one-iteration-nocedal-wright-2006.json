  "claim": "Newton's method minimizes the quadratic model $m_k(p) = f_k + p^T\\nabla f_k + \\frac{1}{2}p^T\\nabla^2 f_k p$ exactly by solving $\\nabla m_k(p) = 0$, yielding $p_k^N = -(\\nabla^2 f_k)^{-1}\\nabla f_k$. For quadratic functions $f(x) = \\frac{1}{2}x^TAx - b^Tx$ where $A \\succ 0$, the quadratic model is exact (no $O(\\|p\\|^3)$ remainder), so Newton's method finds the global minimum $x^* = A^{-1}b$ in exactly one iteration with step size $\\alpha = 1$.",
  "quote": "Another important search direction—perhaps the most important one of all—is the Newton direction. This direction is derived from the second-order Taylor series approximation to $f(x_k + p)$, which is\n\n$f(x_k + p) \\approx f_k + p^T\\nabla f_k + \\frac{1}{2}p^T\\nabla^2 f_k p = m_k(p)$.  (2.14)\n\nAssuming for the moment that $\\nabla^2 f_k$ is positive definite, we obtain the Newton direction by finding the vector $p$ that minimizes $m_k(p)$. By simply setting the derivative of $m_k(p)$ to zero, we obtain the following explicit formula:\n\n$p_k^N = -(\\nabla^2 f_k)^{-1}\\nabla f_k$.  (2.15)",
  "notes": "Internal: This is a derived result, not a stated theorem. Nocedal & Wright present equations (2.14)-(2.15) showing Newton's method minimizes the quadratic model. The one-iteration property for quadratics follows from the exactness of the model. Used in DiagonalPrecondTab to explain why diagonal preconditioning equals Newton when Hessian is diagonal.",
  "readerNotes": "The one-iteration property is not explicitly stated but follows from two facts: (1) Newton's method finds the minimum of the quadratic model $m_k(p)$ by solving $\\nabla m_k(p) = 0$ (equations 2.14-2.15), and (2) for quadratic $f$, the model is exact—there is no $O(\\|p\\|^3)$ remainder term. Therefore, minimizing the model finds the global minimum in one step: $x_1 = x_0 - A^{-1}(Ax_0 - b) = A^{-1}b = x^*$.",

Extracted formula crops following 3-checkpoint workflow: (1) Cropped both equations with generous padding, (2) Extracted LaTeX with proper escaping, (3) Verified crops are complete with no clipping of equation numbers or mathematical content. The one-iteration result is derived from these equations combined with the exactness of the quadratic model for quadratic functions.",
