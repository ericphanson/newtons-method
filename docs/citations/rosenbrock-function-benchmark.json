The function f(x,y) = (1-x)² + 100(y-x²)² (equivalently written as 100(y-x²)² + (1-x)²) appears in Table 1 on page 178 as a test example. The parameter 100 is the coefficient b that controls the steepness of the valley. This citation is for attribution only - no specific theorem or claim is being cited. The 'claim' field is intentionally empty for benchmark function attributions.",
  "readerNotes": "The Rosenbrock function, introduced by H.H. Rosenbrock in 1960, is one of the most famous benchmark functions for testing optimization algorithms. The function creates a narrow, curved valley (resembling a banana) where the global minimum is easy to find but difficult to converge to, making it ideal for demonstrating the challenges of non-convex optimization. The function is defined on variables x,y ranging from 0 to 1, with global minimum at (1,1).",

The Rosenbrock function f(x,y) = 100(y-x²)² + (1-x)² appears in Table 1 on page 178 (PDF page 4) as a test example for the optimization method. Added proofPages (page 1 for title/attribution, page 4 for function definition). Added quote showing the exact function form. Verified that the function form in the notes matches the actual paper (it does). Page numbers 175-184 are correct (printed page numbers match). The function definition is accurate.",
