  "quote": "Theorem 6.1. Suppose that $f$ is uniformly convex on a convex set $D \\subset R^n$, i.e., there exist $M_1$, $M_2$ such that $M_1 \\|z\\|^2 \\leq z^T G(x) z \\leq M_2 \\|z\\|^2$ for all $z \\in R^n$ and $x \\in D$, where $G(x)$ denotes the Hessian of $f$ at $x$. For any positive definite $B_0$, Algorithm 6.1 generates a sequence $\\{x_k\\}$ which converges to $x^*$. Moreover there is a constant $0 \\leq r < 1$ such that $f_k - f^* \\leq r^k [f_0 - f^*]$.",
  "notes": "Internal: This is the formal convergence theorem for L-BFGS. It proves R-linear convergence (geometric decrease in function value) on uniformly convex functions. Uniformly convex is stronger than strongly convex smooth (uniformly convex requires M_1 I ⪯ ∇²f(x) ⪯ M_2 I to hold globally). The theorem does not provide explicit bounds on the convergence constant r in terms of M_1, M_2, or memory parameter m. Used in AlgorithmExplainer and LbfgsTab.",
  "readerNotes": "Uniform convexity is a global condition that requires the Hessian $\\nabla^2 f(x)$ (denoted $G(x)$ in the paper) to satisfy $M_1 \\|z\\|^2 \\leq z^T \\nabla^2 f(x) z \\leq M_2 \\|z\\|^2$ for ALL $z \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ and ALL $x$ in the domain. This is stronger than strongly convex smooth functions (which require $\\mu I \\preceq \\nabla^2 f(x) \\preceq LI$) because it requires uniform bounds independent of $x$. The theorem establishes R-linear convergence: the function value error $f_k - f^*$ decreases geometrically by at least a constant factor $r < 1$ at each iteration. However, the theorem does not provide an explicit formula for $r$ in terms of the condition number $\\kappa = M_2/M_1$ or the memory parameter $m$. In practice, L-BFGS often achieves linear convergence on strongly convex smooth functions even though this weaker condition is not covered by Theorem 6.1.",

  "verificationNotes": "Verified Theorem 6.1 statement on page 23. The theorem is stated precisely as quoted. The uniform convexity condition M_1||z||² ≤ z^T G(x)z ≤ M_2||z||² is indeed stronger than strong convexity + smoothness. Algorithm 6.1 refers to the L-BFGS algorithm described on page 20. Formula extraction: Successfully extracted the convergence bound f_k - f* ≤ r^k[f_0 - f*] from equation (6.5) using the 3-checkpoint workflow. The crop includes context showing this is the R-linear convergence result, with all subscripts, superscripts, and the inequality symbol fully visible.",
