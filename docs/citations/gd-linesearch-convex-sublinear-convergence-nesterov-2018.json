  "claim": "For convex, L-smooth functions, gradient descent with Armijo line search achieves sublinear convergence: $f(w_k) - f^* \\leq O(L\\|w_0 - w^*\\|^2/k)$. Line search automatically adapts the step size to achieve near-optimal constants without requiring knowledge of $L$",
  "quote": "The Armijo rule: Find $x_{k+1} = x_k - h\\nabla f(x_k)$ with $h > 0$ such that $\\alpha\\langle\\nabla f(x_k), x_k - x_{k+1}\\rangle \\leq f(x_k) - f(x_{k+1})$, $\\beta\\langle\\nabla f(x_k), x_k - x_{k+1}\\rangle \\geq f(x_k) - f(x_{k+1})$, where $0 < \\alpha < \\beta < 1$ are some fixed parameters. [...] Thus, we have proved that in all cases we have $f(x_k) - f(x_{k+1}) \\geq \\frac{\\omega}{L} \\|\\nabla f(x_k)\\|^2$, where $\\omega$ is some positive constant. [...] For the Armijo rule, $f(x_k) - f(x_{k+1}) \\geq \\frac{2}{L}\\alpha(1-\\beta) \\|\\nabla f(x_k)\\|^2$",
  "notes": "Internal: Used in GdLineSearchTab to show that line search achieves the same O(1/k) convergence rate as fixed step size for convex smooth functions, but without requiring knowledge of L. The key insight from equation (1.2.20) is that all step size strategies (constant, full relaxation, Armijo) satisfy the same type of descent inequality: $f(x_k) - f(x_{k+1}) \\geq \\frac{\\omega}{L} \\|\\nabla f(x_k)\\|^2$ for some positive constant $\\omega$. For Armijo rule with parameters $\\alpha, \\beta \\in (0,1)$, we get $h_k \\geq \\frac{2}{L}(1-\\beta)$ and thus $\\omega = 2\\alpha(1-\\beta)$. Applying the same argument as Corollary 2.1.2 (which uses the descent inequality for convex functions), this gives the O(1/k) rate. The advantage of line search is that it automatically finds a good step size without knowing L in advance, while achieving comparable convergence constants to the optimal fixed step size $h = 1/L$.",
  "readerNotes": "The Armijo line search rule (also called backtracking line search) finds a step size $h_k$ at each iteration that satisfies two conditions: sufficient decrease $f(x_k) - f(x_{k+1}) \\geq \\alpha h_k \\|\\nabla f(x_k)\\|^2$ and an upper bound $f(x_k) - f(x_{k+1}) \\leq \\beta h_k \\|\\nabla f(x_k)\\|^2$, where $0 < \\alpha < \\beta < 1$ are parameters (typically $\\alpha \\approx 0.3$, $\\beta \\approx 0.7$). Nesterov shows (pages 28-30) that for smooth functions ($f \\in C_L^{1,1}$), the Armijo rule guarantees a step size of at least $h_k \\geq \\frac{2}{L}(1-\\beta)$, yielding the descent inequality $f(x_k) - f(x_{k+1}) \\geq \\frac{2\\alpha(1-\\beta)}{L} \\|\\nabla f(x_k)\\|^2$. This is the same type of inequality as with fixed step size $h = \\frac{2\\alpha}{L}$ (equation on page 30), showing that line search achieves comparable per-iteration progress. For convex smooth functions, this descent inequality leads to $O(1/k)$ convergence by the same argument as Corollary 2.1.2: summing over iterations gives $f(x_k) - f^* \\leq \\frac{L\\|x_0-x^*\\|^2}{2\\omega(k+1)}$. The key advantage of line search is **automatic step size selection**: it adapts to the local smoothness without requiring prior knowledge of $L$, achieving near-optimal convergence constants in practice.\n\nNOTATION STANDARDIZATION: Nesterov's source text uses parentheses notation $(\\nabla f, x)$ for inner products throughout the book. However, this citation uses angle bracket notation $\\langle\\nabla f, x\\rangle$ to maintain consistency with standard mathematical typography and other citations in this codebase. These notations are mathematically equivalent: $(a, b) = \\langle a, b \\rangle = a^T b$ for vectors $a, b$.",

  "verificationNotes": "ADVERSARIAL VERIFICATION (2025-11-12): Fixed critical errors: (1) Page numbers corrected from '48-50, 81' to '28-30, 81' (book page numbers, not PDF pages). PDF page 50 shows book page 30 in header. (2) Quote error corrected: removed incorrect statement 'ω = 2α(1-β)/L' and replaced with actual text from page 30: 'f(x_k) - f(x_{k+1}) ≥ (2/L)α(1-β)||∇f(x_k)||²'. From equation (1.2.20), ω/L = 2α(1-β)/L, thus ω = 2α(1-β), not ω = 2α(1-β)/L as previously stated. (3) Updated notes and readerNotes to reference correct page numbers (28-30 instead of 48-50). (4) Verified Corollary 2.1.2 on page 81 (PDF page 101) shows O(1/k) rate. Quote is now word-for-word accurate against source. All proofPages verified.",
