  "notes": "Internal: CRITICAL DISTINCTION - This theorem applies to full BFGS, NOT L-BFGS. Book page 176 (Section 7.2) explicitly states that L-BFGS yields 'an acceptable (albeit linear) rate of convergence.' The limited memory in L-BFGS prevents the Hessian approximation from fully converging to the true Hessian, degrading convergence from superlinear to linear. Used in LbfgsTab with this important caveat. Assumption 6.2 requires Lipschitz continuous Hessian at x*. Condition (6.52) requires sum of distances to converge: Σ||x_k - x*|| < ∞.",
  "readerNotes": "**Important:** This theorem establishes superlinear convergence for **full BFGS**, not L-BFGS. Nocedal & Wright (book page 176, Section 7.2) explicitly state that L-BFGS yields 'an acceptable (albeit **linear**) rate of convergence.' The distinction arises because L-BFGS uses limited memory (only the $M$ most recent correction pairs), preventing the Hessian approximation $B_k$ from fully converging to the true Hessian $\\nabla^2 f(w^*)$. For L-BFGS in practice, the linear convergence rate is still effective, and the method's low memory requirements make it practical for large-scale problems where full BFGS would be infeasible.",

(2) Fixed formula LaTeX for condition (6.52) from wrong '\\sum ||y_k - s^T||' to correct '\\sum ||x_k - x*|| < ∞'. Changed pages from '177-180' (PDF pages) to '157-160, 176' (book pages).
