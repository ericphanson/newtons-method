Then for any positive definite $B_0$, Algorithm 6.1 generates a sequence $\\{x_k\\}$ which converges to $x_*$. Moreover there is a constant $0 \\leq r < 1$ such that $f_k - f_* \\leq r^k[f_0 - f_*]$ which implies that $\\{x_k\\}$ converges R-linearly... R-linear convergence is the best we can expect.",

  "notes": "Internal: CRITICAL CORRECTION - This citation establishes that L-BFGS has LINEAR convergence, NOT superlinear. The paper explicitly states 'R-linear convergence is the best we can expect' (p. 23). This is in contrast to full BFGS, which can achieve superlinear convergence. Nocedal & Wright (2006) p. 196 also confirms L-BFGS has 'acceptable (albeit linear) rate of convergence.' The memory parameter M affects the constant in the linear convergence rate, not the order of convergence. Used in AlgorithmExplainer to correct the incorrect superlinear convergence claim.",
  "readerNotes": "**IMPORTANT:** L-BFGS achieves only **linear convergence**, not superlinear. Liu & Nocedal (1989) Theorem 6.1 proves that L-BFGS has R-linear convergence, and the paper explicitly states 'R-linear convergence is the best we can expect' (p. 23). This is fundamentally different from full BFGS, which can achieve superlinear convergence (Nocedal & Wright 2006, Theorem 6.6). The limited memory in L-BFGS (storing only $M$ recent curvature pairs) prevents the Hessian approximation from fully converging to the true Hessian, which limits the convergence rate to linear. The memory parameter $M$ affects the constant in the linear convergence rate but does NOT change the order of convergence to superlinear. Nocedal & Wright (2006) p. 196 confirms: L-BFGS yields 'an acceptable (albeit linear) rate of convergence.' Despite being 'only' linear, L-BFGS's convergence is still very effective in practice due to its low memory requirements ($O(Md)$ vs $O(d^2)$ for full BFGS) which enable its use on large-scale problems where full BFGS would be infeasible.",
